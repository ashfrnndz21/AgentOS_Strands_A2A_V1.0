```

### **Step 6: Add Human Node**

**Purpose**: Human expert intervention

1. **Drag Human Node** from Utilities
2. **Configure**:

```
Name: "Senior Technical Expert"
Role: "Level 2 Technical Support"

Instructions:
"Review the technical issue context and provide expert-level support. 
You have access to advanced tools and can perform system-level troubleshooting."

Available Actions:
- Remote system access
- Advanced diagnostics
- Hardware replacement authorization
- Escalation to engineering team
```
