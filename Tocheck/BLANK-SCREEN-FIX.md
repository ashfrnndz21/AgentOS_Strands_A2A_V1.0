# ðŸš¨ Blank Screen Fix

## Issue
The app is showing a blank white screen after implementing the Real RAG functionality.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **Missing DocumentRAGService class** - The original DocumentWorkspace was trying to import a class that was replaced
2. **Import conflicts** - Mixed imports between old and new RAG services
3. **Syntax errors** - Auto-formatting may have introduced issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Restored Legacy DocumentRAGService
- Added back the original `DocumentRAGService` class for backward compatibility
- Created mock implementations to prevent errors
- Kept both old and new services in the same file

### 2. Fixed Import Issues
- Fixed DocumentWorkspace to use the correct `DocumentRAGService` import
- Ensured RealDocumentWorkspace uses `RealDocumentRAGService`
- Added proper type definitions for both services

### 3. Added Error Boundary
- Wrapped the entire App in an ErrorBoundary to catch and display errors
- Added debug pages to test functionality

### 4. Created Debug Tools
- Added `/debug` route to test if the app is working
- Created test pages to isolate issues

## Testing Steps

1. **Check if app loads**: Navigate to `/debug` to see if React is rendering
2. **Test original documents**: Go to "ðŸ“„ Chat with Documents" (should work with mock data)
3. **Test real RAG**: Go to "ðŸš€ Real RAG Documents" (requires backend setup)

## If Still Blank

### Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Look for import/export errors or missing dependencies

### Common Issues
- **Missing UI components**: Check if all imported components exist
- **TypeScript errors**: Look for type mismatches
- **Import path issues**: Verify all `@/` imports resolve correctly

### Quick Fix Commands
```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DocumentRAGService.ts (contains both old and new services)
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DocumentWorkspace.tsx (uses legacy service)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ RealDocumentWorkspace.tsx (uses real RAG service)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DebugPage.tsx (for testing)
â””â”€â”€ App.tsx (with ErrorBoundary)
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the debug page first
2. If working, test the document workspaces
3. Install RAG dependencies if using real RAG functionality
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors
