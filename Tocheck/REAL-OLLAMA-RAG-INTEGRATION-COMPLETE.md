"What recommendations are made?"
```

## üîß **Technical Architecture:**

### **Document Processing Pipeline:**
```
File Upload ‚Üí Text Extraction ‚Üí Chunking ‚Üí RAG Index ‚Üí Ready for Chat
```

### **Chat Pipeline:**
```
User Query ‚Üí Find Relevant Chunks ‚Üí Create Context ‚Üí Ollama Generation ‚Üí Response with Sources
```

### **Key Components:**

**DocumentRAGService:**
- Extracts text from files (PDF simulation included)
- Splits text into searchable chunks
- Finds relevant content for queries
- Integrates with Ollama for responses

**Real Ollama Integration:**
- Uses existing OllamaService
- Supports model selection
- Provides context-aware prompts
- Returns responses with source citations

## üé® **UI Enhancements:**

### **Model Selector:**
- Choose from popular Ollama models
- Real-time model switching

- Source citations for transparency

## üîç **What Happens Behind the Scenes:**

### **Document Upload:**
1. File is read and text extracted
2. Text is split into 1000-character chunks with 200-character overlap
3. Chunks are indexed for fast retrieval
4. Document marked as "Ready" for chat

### **Chat Query:**
1. User query analyzed for keywords
2. Relevant chunks found using simple scoring
3. Context created from top 5 relevant chunks
4. Ollama prompt constructed with context
5. AI generates response based on document content
6. Sources cited for transparency

### **Example RAG Prompt:**
```
Based on the following document excerpts, please answer the user's question.

DOCUMENT CONTEXT:
[Relevant chunks from your documents]

USER QUESTION: What are the main recommendations?

ANSWER: [Ollama generates contextual response]
```
