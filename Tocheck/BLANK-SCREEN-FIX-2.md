# ðŸš¨ Blank Screen Fix #2

## Issue
The app went blank again after auto-formatting, likely due to issues with the UnifiedDocumentWorkspace component.

## Quick Fix Applied

### 1. Created Minimal Document Workspace
- Simplified version that focuses on core functionality
- Tests Ollama integration without complex UI components
- Isolates potential import/component issues

### 2. Step-by-Step Approach
Instead of a complex unified workspace, I've created:
- **MinimalDocumentWorkspace** - Basic Ollama model loading and display
- **SimpleDocumentTest** - Fallback test page

### 3. What to Test
1. Navigate to "ðŸ’¬ Document Chat" in the sidebar
2. Check if the minimal workspace loads
3. Verify Ollama models are detected
4. Confirm basic UI is working

## If Still Blank

### Check Browser Console
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Look for JavaScript errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Common Issues
- Missing UI components
- Import path problems
- TypeScript errors
- Component rendering issues

## Next Steps

Once the minimal workspace is working:
1. âœ… Confirm Ollama integration works
2. âœ… Add document upload functionality
3. âœ… Add chat interface
4. âœ… Build up to full functionality

## Files Created
- `src/pages/MinimalDocumentWorkspace.tsx` - Simplified version
- `src/pages/SimpleDocumentTest.tsx` - Basic test page

## Current Route
- `/documents` â†’ MinimalDocumentWorkspace (testing Ollama integration)

The goal is to get something working first, then build up the functionality step by step.
