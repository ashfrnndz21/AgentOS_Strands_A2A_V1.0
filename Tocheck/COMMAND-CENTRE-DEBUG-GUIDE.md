# Command Centre Debug Guide

## Current Issue
The Command Centre is still not working properly. Let's debug this step by step.

## Debug Routes Created
1. `/agent-command` - Debug version with minimal QuickActions
2. `/agent-command-simple` - Very basic test version  
3. `/agent-command-full` - Full original version

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Basic Routing Test
1. Navigate to `/agent-command-simple`
2. Verify you see "Agent Command Centre - Simple Test"
3. Test the buttons work
4. If this fails, there's a routing issue

### Step 2: Component Import Test  
1. Navigate to `/agent-command`
2. Verify you see "Agent Command Centre - Debug"
3. Test the QuickActions dropdown
4. Try clicking "Create Agent (Test)"
5. If this fails, there's an import issue with CreateAgentDialog

### Step 3: Full Component Test
1. Navigate to `/agent-command-full`
2. This should show the full Command Centre
3. If this fails, we know which component is problematic

## Debugging Process

### If Step 1 Fails (Basic Routing)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're navigating to the correct URL
- Check if Layout component has issues

### If Step 2 Fails (Component Imports)
- Check browser console for import errors
- Look for missing dependencies
- Check if CreateAgentDialog has syntax errors

### If Step 3 Fails (Full Component)
- One of the imported components in QuickActions is broken
- Need to add imports one by one to identify the problematic component

## Current Status
- âœ… Created debug versions
- âœ… Set up step-by-step testing
- ðŸ”„ Ready for testing

## Next Steps Based on Results

### If All Tests Pass
- The issue might be browser cache or you're on wrong URL
- Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check the URL bar

### If Tests Fail
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Identify which component is causing the issue
- Fix the specific problematic component

## URLs to Test
- http://localhost:5173/agent-command-simple (basic test)
- http://localhost:5173/agent-command (debug version)  
- http://localhost:5173/agent-command-full (full version)

Please test these URLs in order and let me know which ones work and which ones show errors.
