## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live execution progress in UI
- Step-by-step agent handoffs
- Response times and confidence scores
- Error detection and reporting

### Debug Tools
```bash
# Check system health
curl http://localhost:5001/health

# List available agents
curl http://localhost:5001/api/agents/available

# Test specific agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/agents/test_agent/test
```

### Log Monitoring
- Backend logs show detailed execution
- Frontend console shows API calls
- Ollama logs show model interactions

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **"No agents available"**
   - Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
   - Check models are installed: `ollama list`
   - Restart backend to trigger auto-registration

2. **"Workflow execution failed"**
   - Check agent connections in UI
   - Verify Ollama models are responding
   - Check backend logs for errors

3. **"Frontend not updating"**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify backend is running on port 5001
   - Clear browser cache and reload

4. **"Agent registration fails"**
   - Ensure Ollama models are pulled
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify backend has proper permissions

## 🎯 Next Steps & Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Create Custom Workflows**: Build complex multi-stage workflows
2. **Add More Agents**: Register specialized Ollama models
3. **Test Different Tasks**: Try various business scenarios
4. **Monitor Performance**: Analyze execution metrics
