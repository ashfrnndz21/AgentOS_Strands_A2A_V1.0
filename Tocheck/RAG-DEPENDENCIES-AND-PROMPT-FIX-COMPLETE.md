# RAG Dependencies and Prompt Fix - Complete Solution

## Root Cause Identified
The AI was saying "I don't have access to personal data" due to two critical issues:

### 1. Missing RAG Dependencies
The backend was missing the `fastembed` package, causing RAG queries to fail silently:
```
Could not import 'fastembed' Python package. Please install it with `pip install fastembed`.
```

### 2. Overly Restrictive AI Prompt
The RAG prompt was instructing the AI to be overly cautious:
```python
# OLD PROMPT (too restrictive)
"If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise."
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Installed Missing Dependencies
```bash
python -m pip install fastembed chromadb pypdf
```

All RAG dependencies are now properly installed:
- ✅ `fastembed` - For fast embeddings
- ✅ `chromadb` - For vector storage  
- ✅ `pypdf` - For PDF processing
- ✅ `langchain` - For RAG pipeline
- ✅ `langchain-community` - For Ollama integration

### 2. Updated RAG Prompt Template
```python
# NEW PROMPT (document-analysis focused)
self.prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
    <s> [INST] You are a helpful document analysis assistant. Use the provided context from the uploaded documents to answer questions accurately and comprehensively.
    
    The context contains information from documents that the user has explicitly uploaded for analysis. You should provide detailed, helpful answers based on this content.
    
    If the information is not in the provided context, say so clearly. Otherwise, provide a complete and informative response based on the document content. [/INST] </s>
    [INST] Question: {question}
    
    Context from uploaded documents:
    {context}
    
    Answer: [/INST]
""")
```

### 3. Backend Restart Required
The backend has been restarted to apply all changes. **Documents need to be re-uploaded** because the in-memory storage was cleared.

## What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Re-Upload Your Document
1. Go to the **"Upload Documents"** tab
2. Upload your `Ashley_Fernandez_Resume_2025.pdf` again
3. Wait for processing to complete (should show chunks created)

### Step 2: Verify Auto-Selection
1. Check that "Selected: 1" appears in the right panel
2. Processing logs should show "Auto-selected [filename] for chat"

### Step 3: Test the Chat
Try these questions:
- "What is the person's name in this resume?"
- "What work experience does Ashley have?"
- "What skills are mentioned?"
- "What education background is listed?"

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ RAG queries failed due to missing `fastembed`
- ❌ AI refused to discuss "personal data"
- ❌ Overly cautious responses

### After Fix:
- ✅ RAG pipeline fully functional
- ✅ AI analyzes uploaded documents confidently
- ✅ Detailed, helpful responses about document content
- ✅ Clear distinction between uploaded content and external data

## Technical Verification

### Check RAG Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rag/status
# Should return: {"status": "available", "dependencies": {...}}
```

### Test RAG Query (after re-upload)
The AI should now provide specific information from your resume instead of privacy-related refusals.

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Dependencies**: All RAG packages installed and working
2. **Prompt**: Updated to encourage document analysis rather than restrict it
3. **Backend**: Restarted with new configuration
4. **Auto-Selection**: Documents automatically selected for chat

The core issue was that the RAG system wasn't actually working due to missing dependencies, and when it did work, the prompt was too restrictive. Both issues are now resolved.

**Next Step: Re-upload your document and test the chat functionality!**
