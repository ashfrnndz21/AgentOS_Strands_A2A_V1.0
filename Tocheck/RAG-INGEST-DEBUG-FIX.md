# RAG Ingest Debug and Fix

## Problem Identified
The document appears to be uploaded but is not being ingested into the RAG system:
- ✅ Document shows as uploaded in UI
- ❌ RAG system shows 0 ingested documents
- ❌ Selected documents shows 0
- ❌ AI cannot access document content

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Document Not Actually Ingested
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/rag/documents
# Returns: {"documents":[],"total":0,"real_rag":true}
```

### 2. Document Selection Issue
The right panel shows "Selected: 0" which means no documents are selected for chat.

### 3. Possible Issues
- Frontend upload not calling RAG ingest endpoint
- RAG ingest failing silently
- Document selection not working after upload
- Error in the upload/ingest pipeline

## Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Manual Document Selection
1. Click **"Select All Documents"** button in Quick Actions
2. Verify "Selected: 1" appears in right panel
3. Try asking a question again

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any JavaScript errors during upload
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

### Step 3: Re-upload Document
1. Go to "Upload Documents" tab
2. Upload the PDF again
3. Watch the processing logs carefully
4. Check if "Auto-selected [filename] for chat" appears

### Step 4: Test RAG Ingest Directly
Use the test file `test-rag-ingest.html`:
1. Open the file in browser
2. Select your PDF
3. Click "Test Ingest"
4. Check if ingest succeeds

## Expected Behavior vs Actual

### Expected:
1. Document uploaded → RAG ingest called → Document ingested → Auto-selected → Chat works

### Actual:
1. Document uploaded → ??? → Document NOT ingested → NOT selected → Chat fails

## Immediate Actions

### Action 1: Manual Selection Test
Click "Select All Documents" and test if chat works with manual selection.

### Action 2: Check Processing Logs
Look for error messages in the Document Processing Logs panel.

### Action 3: Browser Console Check
Check for JavaScript errors that might be preventing proper upload.

## Next Steps
Based on the debugging results, we can:
1. Fix the ingest pipeline if it's failing
2. Fix the auto-selection if documents are ingested but not selected
3. Add better error handling and user feedback

The key is to identify whether the issue is:
- A) Document not being ingested into RAG system
- B) Document ingested but not selected for chat
- C) Document selected but RAG query failing

**Try the manual "Select All Documents" button first to see if that resolves the issue.**
