# Strands SDK Tool Detection Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of proper tool detection for Strands SDK agents, following official Strands SDK patterns and best practices.

## Strands SDK Approach vs Custom Detection

### ❌ Previous Approach (Incorrect)
- Manual keyword detection in backend
- Hardcoded response pattern matching
- Custom logic to determine tool usage
- Not following Strands SDK patterns

### ✅ New Approach (Strands-Compliant)
- **Natural Language Invocation**: Agents automatically determine when to use tools based on user input
- **Rich Tool Descriptions**: Following Strands best practices for tool documentation
- **Agent Context Awareness**: Tools calls and results are part of conversation history
- **Configurable Detection**: Frontend interface for customizing detection patterns

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Tool Descriptions

Following Strands SDK best practices, tools now have comprehensive descriptions:

```python
@tool
def web_search(query: str) -> str:
    """
    Search the web for information about a query.
    
    Use this tool when you need to find current information, facts, news, or data
    that is not in your training data. This tool is ideal for:
    - Current events and news
    - Recent developments in technology, science, or other fields
    - Factual information about people, places, or organizations
    - Product information and reviews
    - Weather, stock prices, or other real-time data
    
    Args:
        query: The search query string. Be specific and use relevant keywords.
               Examples: "latest AI developments 2024", "Python programming tutorial"
    
    Returns:
        Search results with summaries and source URLs when available.
    """
```

### 2. Proper Tool Usage Detection

The system now attempts to extract tool usage information directly from the Strands agent response:

```python
# Try to extract tool usage from Strands agent response
if hasattr(response, 'tool_calls') and response.tool_calls:
    for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
        if hasattr(tool_call, 'name'):
            tools_used.append(tool_call.name)
elif hasattr(response, 'tools_used') and response.tools_used:
    tools_used = response.tools_used
elif hasattr(response, 'metadata') and response.metadata:
    if 'tools_used' in response.metadata:
        tools_used = response.metadata['tools_used']
```

### 3. Configurable Detection Fallback

For cases where direct tool usage information isn't available, the system provides a configurable fallback detection mechanism through the frontend interface.

### 4. Frontend Tool Configuration

The new `StrandsToolConfigDialog` component allows users to:

- **Configure Detection Keywords**: Customize input keywords that suggest tool usage
- **Set Response Patterns**: Define patterns in responses that indicate tool usage
- **Enable/Disable Tools**: Control which tools are monitored
- **Tool Descriptions**: Document when each tool should be used

## API Endpoints

### Get Tool Configuration
```
GET /api/strands-sdk/tool-config
```

### Update Tool Configuration
```
POST /api/strands-sdk/tool-config
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "config": {
    "web_search": {
      "enabled": true,
      "keywords": ["search", "find", "what is", "latest"],
      "responsePatterns": ["found information", "summary:", "source:"],
      "description": "Detects web search usage"
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Strands SDK Compliance**: Follows official patterns for tool invocation
2. **Better Tool Descriptions**: Improves agent decision-making about when to use tools
3. **Configurable Detection**: Users can customize detection patterns per their needs
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation when direct tool usage info isn't available
5. **Real-time Streaming**: Tool usage is detected and reported in real-time during execution

## Usage Example

1. **Create Agent with Tools**: Select tools during agent creation
2. **Configure Detection** (Optional): Click "Configure Tool Detection" to customize patterns
3. **Natural Language Interaction**: Ask questions that naturally trigger tool usage
   - "What's the latest news about AI?" → Triggers web search
   - "Calculate 25 * 4 + 10" → Triggers calculator
   - "What time is it?" → Triggers current time tool

## Real-time Progress Display

The system now shows actual tool usage in real-time:

```
[RUNNING] Initializing Strands SDK
[RUNNING] Agent configured with tools: ['web_search']
[RUNNING] Loaded tool: web_search
[RUNNING] Starting agent execution
[RUNNING] Web search tool successful
[COMPLETED] Response generated
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **MCP Tool Support**: Integration with Model Context Protocol tools
2. **Community Tools**: Support for Strands community tool packages
3. **Tool Analytics**: Detailed analytics on tool usage patterns
4. **Custom Tool Creation**: Interface for creating custom tools

This implementation provides a robust, Strands-compliant foundation for tool detection while maintaining flexibility and user control.
