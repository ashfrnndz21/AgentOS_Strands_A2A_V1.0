# Custom Tabs Test - Bypassing UI Library

## 🎯 **What I Did:**
1. ✅ Created a completely custom tabs implementation (`CustomTabs.tsx`)
2. ✅ Used native HTML `<button>` elements instead of the UI library's `TabsTrigger`
3. ✅ Used simple conditional rendering instead of `TabsContent`
4. ✅ Added console logging to track clicks
5. ✅ Replaced the MainTabs with CustomTabs in CommandCentre

## 🧪 **What This Tests:**
- **If CustomTabs work**: The issue is with the UI library's Tabs component
- **If CustomTabs don't work**: The issue is deeper (CSS conflicts, React state, etc.)

## 🔍 **What to Look For:**
1. Navigate to `/agent-command`
2. Try clicking each tab button
3. Check browser console for "🖱️ Custom tab clicked: [tab_name]" messages
4. Verify that:
   - Tab buttons are visually clickable (hover effects)
   - Active tab has blue background
   - Content changes when clicking tabs
   - Debug information shows correctly

## 📊 **Expected Results:**
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Shows project cards (Hydrogen Production, Financial Forecasting, Process Engineering)
- ✅ **Traceability**: Shows "✅ Traceability tab is working!" with project info
- ✅ **Tools**: Shows "✅ Tools tab is working!" with industry info
- ✅ **Data**: Shows "✅ Data tab is working!" with data sources info
- ✅ **Governance**: Shows "✅ Governance tab is working!" with compliance info
- ✅ **Cost**: Shows "✅ Cost tab is working!" with budget info
- ✅ **Monitor**: Shows "✅ Monitoring tab is working!" with system status

## 🔧 **Technical Details:**
- Uses native `<button>` elements with `onClick` handlers
- Simple conditional rendering: `{activeTab === 'tools' && <div>...</div>}`
- No dependency on UI library's Tabs component
- Direct state management with `setActiveTab(tabId)`

## 📝 **Next Steps Based on Results:**

### If CustomTabs Work:
1. **Issue identified**: The UI library's Tabs component has a problem
2. **Solution**: Either fix the UI library or use the custom implementation
3. **Gradually add back**: Original content components to the custom tabs

### If CustomTabs Don't Work:
1. **Check console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check CSS**: Look for `pointer-events: none` or z-index issues
3. **Check React**: Verify state updates are working
4. **Check browser**: Try different browser or incognito mode

## 🎨 **Visual Differences:**
- Custom tabs use simple gray/blue styling
- No complex animations or transitions
- Clear visual feedback for active/hover states
- Simplified responsive behavior

This should definitively tell us if the problem is with the UI library or something else!
