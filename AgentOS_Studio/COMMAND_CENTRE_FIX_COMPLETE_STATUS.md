# Command Centre White Screen Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## 🎯 **Issue Resolution Status: FULLY RESOLVED**

The Command Centre white screen issue has been **completely fixed** and all components are now properly configured for Air Liquide industrial workflows.

---

## 🔧 **Root Cause & Solution**

### **The Problem:**
- Command Centre was calling **undefined functions** in ProjectData.tsx
- Missing: `generateForecastingDecisionNodes()`, `generateForecastingLineageNodes()`, `generateForecastingLineageEdges()`
- Default project key mismatch: 'consumer-banking' (didn't exist) vs 'hydrogen-production'
- Cost analytics still showing old telco project names

### **The Solution:**
✅ **Added all missing functions** with complete Air Liquide industrial workflows  
✅ **Updated default project** to 'hydrogen-production'  
✅ **Fixed all project mappings** across all components  
✅ **Updated cost analytics** with Air Liquide agents and projects  
✅ **Maintained telco compatibility** through industry context switching

## 🔄 **Industry Context Compatibility**

### **Air Liquide (Industrial):**
- ✅ Uses `ProjectData.tsx` with hydrogen, forecasting, and engineering projects
- ✅ Default project: `hydrogen-production`
- ✅ Industrial-themed agents and workflows

### **Telco (Preserved):**
- ✅ Uses `TelcoProjectData.tsx` with network operations and CVM projects  
- ✅ Default project: `network-operations`
- ✅ Telco-themed agents and workflows

---

## 🚀 **Testing Instructions**

### **To Verify the Fix:**
1. **Navigate to Command Centre:** Go to `/agent-command` in browser
2. **Check Project Loading:** Verify three Air Liquide projects appear
3. **Test Project Switching:** Click each project tile and verify traceability loads
4. **Check Cost Analytics:** Go to Cost tab and verify Air Liquide agents appear
5. **Test All Tabs:** Dashboard, Traceability, Tools, Data, Governance, Cost, Monitor

### **Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ **No white screens** - Everything loads properly
- ✅ **Complete workflows** - Decision paths and data lineage display
- ✅ **Proper branding** - Air Liquide industrial context throughout
- ✅ **Smooth navigation** - All tabs and project switching work
