# Tab Clicking Fix - Test Results

## Changes Made:
1. ✅ Removed complex debugging and error handling from MainTabs
2. ✅ Simplified the tab change handler
3. ✅ Simplified CSS classes for TabsList and TabsTrigger components
4. ✅ Removed complex responsive styling that might cause conflicts
5. ✅ Reverted back to original MainTabs (removed SimpleMainTabs)

## Simplified Styling:
- **Before**: Complex beam-dark styling with responsive classes
- **After**: Simple gray/blue styling with standard Tailwind classes

## What to Test:
1. Navigate to `/agent-command`
2. Try clicking each tab: Traceability, Tools, Data, Governance, Cost, Monitor
3. Verify that:
   - Tabs are visually clickable (hover effects work)
   - Tab content changes when clicked
   - Active tab styling is applied correctly
   - No JavaScript errors in console

## Expected Results:
- ✅ All tabs should be clickable
- ✅ Content should switch between tabs
- ✅ Active tab should be highlighted in blue
- ✅ No console errors

## If Still Not Working:
The issue might be:
1. **UI Library Problem**: The Tabs component from @/components/ui/tabs might have issues
2. **CSS Conflicts**: Some global CSS might be interfering
3. **JavaScript Errors**: Check browser console for any errors
4. **State Management**: Issue with React state updates

## Next Steps if Tabs Still Don't Work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Try using native HTML buttons instead of Tabs component
3. Check if other parts of the app use Tabs successfully
4. Verify the UI library installation
