# Tab Content Debug Test

## What I Changed:
1. ✅ Added visible wrapper divs with gray backgrounds to all tab content
2. ✅ Added debug information showing current state
3. ✅ Temporarily commented out complex content components
4. ✅ Added simple text content to verify tab switching works

## What to Test:
1. Navigate to `/agent-command`
2. Click on each tab: **Traceability**, **Tools**, **Data**, **Governance**, **Cost**, **Monitor**
3. For each tab, you should now see:
   - A gray box with white text
   - Debug information showing current industry and project
   - Confirmation that the tab content is loading

## Expected Results:
- ✅ **Traceability Tab**: Should show project info and data availability
- ✅ **Tools Tab**: Should show "This is the Tools tab content..."
- ✅ **Data Tab**: Should show "This is the Data tab content..."
- ✅ **Governance Tab**: Should show "This is the Governance tab content..."
- ✅ **Cost Tab**: Should show cost analytics (still using original component)
- ✅ **Monitor Tab**: Should show monitoring content (still using original component)

## What This Test Reveals:
- **If you can see the debug content**: Tab switching is working, the issue was with the content components
- **If you still see nothing**: There's a deeper issue with the Tabs component or React rendering

## Next Steps Based on Results:
### If Debug Content Shows:
1. Gradually uncomment the original content components one by one
2. Identify which specific component is causing the issue
3. Fix the problematic component

### If Debug Content Doesn't Show:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify the Tabs UI component is working properly
3. Check for CSS conflicts preventing content display

## Debug Information Displayed:
- Current industry ID
- Selected project
- Project data availability
- Number of decision nodes and agents (for traceability)

This should help us identify exactly where the problem is occurring!
