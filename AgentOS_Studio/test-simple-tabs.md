# Simple Tabs Test

## What was changed:
1. Created `SimpleMainTabs.tsx` - a minimal tabs component with just basic content
2. Temporarily replaced the complex `MainTabs` with `SimpleMainTabs` in CommandCentre page
3. Added console logging to track tab changes

## To test:
1. Navigate to `/agent-command` in the browser
2. Try clicking the different tabs (Traceability, Tools, Data, etc.)
3. Check browser console for debug messages
4. Verify if tabs are now clickable and switching content

## Expected results:
- If SimpleMainTabs works: The issue is in the complex MainTabs component (likely in content components)
- If SimpleMainTabs doesn't work: The issue is with the Tabs UI component or parent state management

## Debug messages to look for:
- `🔍 SimpleMainTabs render - activeTab: [tab_name]`
- `🔄 SimpleMainTabs - Tab change requested: [tab_name]`

## Next steps based on results:
- **If it works**: Gradually add back the complex content to identify which component is causing the issue
- **If it doesn't work**: Check for CSS conflicts, JavaScript errors, or UI library issues
