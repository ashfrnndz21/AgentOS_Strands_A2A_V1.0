## ✅ **What Was Removed:**

### 🗂️ **Left Sidebar Navigation:**
- **Banking Theme**: Removed "Banking Agents" menu item
- **Telco Theme**: Removed "Network Agents" menu item  
- **Healthcare Theme**: Removed "Healthcare Agents" menu item
- **Industrial Theme**: Removed "Industrial Agents" menu item

### 🏠 **Main Dashboard:**
- **Removed "AI Agents" tile** from the main dashboard grid
- This tile previously linked to `/agents` route

### 🔗 **Routes Removed:**
- `/agents` - No longer accessible from navigation
- The actual page files still exist but are not linked

## 📋 **Files Modified:**

### `src/contexts/IndustryContext.tsx`
- Removed `{ path: '/agents', label: 'Banking Agents', icon: 'Bot' }` from banking navigation
- Removed `{ path: '/agents', label: 'Network Agents', icon: 'Bot' }` from telco navigation

- Removed `{ path: '/agents', label: 'Industrial Agents', icon: 'Bot' }` from industrial navigation

### `src/components/MainContent.tsx`

## 🎯 **Result:**

Users can no longer access:
- ❌ AI Agents section from the left sidebar
- ❌ AI Agents tile from the main dashboard
- ❌ Direct navigation to `/agents` route

The application now focuses on:
- ✅ Command Centre for operations management
- ✅ Multi Agent Workspace for workflow building
- ✅ Industry-specific analytics and monitoring
- ✅ MCP Gateway and other core features

## 📝 **Note:**
The actual agent-related page files (`src/pages/Agents.tsx`, etc.) still exist in the codebase but are no longer accessible through the UI navigation. If you want to completely remove these files as well, let me know and I can delete them.
